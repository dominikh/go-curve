# curve

Package curve provides primitives and routines for 2D shapes, curves, and
paths. It was designed to serve the needs of 2D graphics applications, but it
is intended to be general enough to be useful for other applications.

# Kurbo

This package is a manual, idiomatic Go port of the
[kurbo](https://github.com/linebender/kurbo) Rust crate. Kurbo contains several
novel approaches to problems in 2D curve design, particularly stroke expansion.
This package's development will closely follow kurbo's.

We may introduce functionality of our own, but this will likely be limited to
simple features.

# Documentation

See https://pkg.go.dev/honnef.co/go/curve for the package documentation.
